"you missed THE CRITICAL STEP in your video; How to startup your PC without ALL the startup programs. Because there are some programs like Riva Tuner that you can't uninstall while they're running, and if you try to even stop them from the task manager they will keep restarting. And windows doesn't give you an option to force stop a program when trying to uninstall it. So starting your PC up and Windows without ANY of the startup programs is a critical step you skipped over. It's one of the reasons I am searching on youtube how to uninstall start up programs. And when I go to startup programs, in this case, Riva tuner isn't even there in the list of startup apps.",pos
